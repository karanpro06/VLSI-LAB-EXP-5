**5. SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE**

**AIM:** 

To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Vivado 2023.2.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:** 

VIVADO 2023.2

**PROCEDURE:**

1. Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

2. Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

3. Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

4. Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

5. Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

6. Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

7. Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

8. Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

9. View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

**VERILOG CODE:**

**FINITE STATE MACHINE:**


module FSM_moore(clk, rst, x, z);

input clk, rst, x;

output z;

reg [2:1] present_state, NEXT_STATE;

parameter S0=2'b00, S1=2'b01, S2=2'b10, S3=2'b11;

// define the next state combinational circuit

always@(x,present_state)

case(present_state)

S0: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S1: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

S2: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S3;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S3: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

endcase

//define the sequential block

always@(negedge rst, posedge clk)

if(rst)

present_state<=S0;

else

present_state<=NEXT_STATE;

assign z=(present_state==S3); // define output

endmodule



**OUTPUT:**

**RESULT:**

Thus the simulation and synthesis of finite state machine using Vivado 2023.2 was successfully executed and verified
